### Worksheet Preparation

Creating the worksheet for the British Airways dashboard involved several key points:

  - **Average Custom Metric By Country (Map, Custom Parameter, Calculated Field, Advanced Filters):**
   1.  Map Visualization: Utilized a map to display the average custom metric (e.g., overall rating) by country.
   2.  Custom Parameter: Created a custom parameter to allow users to select the metric they want to visualize (e.g., food overall rating, cabin staff service).
   3.  Calculated Field: Developed a calculated field to calculate the average custom metric based on the selected parameter.
   4.  Advanced Filters: Implemented advanced filters to allow users to filter data based on criteria such as time frame or specific attributes.

  
  - **Average Custom Metric By Month (Line Chart):**
   1. Line Chart: Used a line chart to show the trend of the average custom metric over time (by month).
   2. Time-Based Aggregation: Aggregated data by month to calculate the average custom metric for each month.
   3. Data Granularity: Ensured that the data was granular enough to capture variations in the metric over time.

  
  - **Dashboard Layout: Organized the worksheets into a cohesive layout that is easy to navigate and understand.**
   1. Interactive Elements: Added interactive elements such as filters and highlight actions to enhance user experience.
   2. Formatting: Ensured consistent formatting (e.g., colors, fonts) across all elements of the dashboard for a polished look.
   3. User-Friendly Design: Designed the dashboard with a focus on usability, making it intuitive for users to explore and analyze the data.
